Now copy this file as .vimrc in your $HOME

To install plugins. Open vim and run  :PluginInstall. You should see a second split window within vim that shows that 
plugins are installing. 

The following plugins are installed with vundle in .vimrc

1.Colorscheme solarized
2.Enable 256 colors in terminal for vim
3. Plugins managed by vundle
    a. YouCompleteme. Provides autocompletion. You need to actually run the install in the $HOME/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe. This
    provides auto completion and bunch of other stuff for a lot of languages. you need to install the C language support and
    javascript support manually by first downloading the plugin using PluginInstall command within vim. Then navigate to 
    $HOME/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteme directory and run the following commands
       i. ./install.py --clang-complete. 
       ii. ./install.py --tern-completer. This supports nodejs and javascript. Make sure they are installed first.
    b. ColorSolarized. You dont need to do anything within .vimrc besides mention it and install it. More information here

    c. Powerline for doing things with git within vim. But I have never gotten this to work or seen it work in terminal window.
    d. vim fugitive. This is also meant for doing git shit within vim. but havent figured out how to do this from within vim.
    e. Nerdtree - Navigate filesystem from within vim.
    f. python-mode. God only knows, just copied it from somewhere. Right now it is disabled.
